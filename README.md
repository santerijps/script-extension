# Script-Extension
Script-Extension is a Chrome web extension that allows the user to attach JavaScript code to each web site host. The attached code will then be run each time the host is accessed. The code is run inside an anonymous function in order to only exist within its own scope.

## Key bindings
- Open/close the code editor: Ctrl + I
- Close the code editor: Esc
- Execute the code and close the code editor: Ctrl + Enter
- Ctrl + S does nothing.
